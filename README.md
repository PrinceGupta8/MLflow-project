# MLflow Project 🚀

**A structured MLflow pipeline showcasing end-to-end experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment readiness.**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full ML lifecycle using MLflow. It logs experiments, compares models, registers the best model to a model registry, and prepares deployment-ready artifacts.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🔹 Data ingestion and preprocessing  
- 🔹 Experiment tracking for multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- 🔹 Model evaluation and best-run selection  
- 🔹 MLflow model registry integration  
- 🔹 Exportable models with `MLmodel` and conda environment for reproducible deployment

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrinceGupta8/MLflow-project.git
cd MLflow-project
````

### 2. Create Conda environment (recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f conda.yaml
conda activate mlflow-env
```

Alternatively, use:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running Experiments with MLflow

Start MLflow UI (in a separate terminal):

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Run the training experiment:

```bash
mlflow run .
```

This will:

1. Ingest and preprocess data
2. Train multiple models
3. Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts
4. Register the best model in MLflow Model Registry

Access the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`

---

## ▶️ Inference / Prediction

Use a logged model for predictions:

```bash
python src/predict.py \
  --model-uri "models:/<RegisteredModelName>/Production" \
  --input data/new_data.csv \
  --output results/predictions.csv
```

---

## 📈 Evaluation & Comparison

* Use MLflow UI to compare experiment runs
* Visualize metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
* Inspect feature importance or confusion matrix artifacts

---

## ✅ Roadmap & Enhancements

* [ ] Automate hyperparameter tuning (Grid/Random Search, Optuna)
* [ ] CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions) for repeatable builds
* [ ] Dockerize pipeline for production deployment
* [ ] Extend support to deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* [ ] Add custom model validation via MLflow callbacks

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/xyz`
3. Commit your changes, add tests, and update documentation
